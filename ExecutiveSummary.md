###Solutions:
Manual process is not needed to show the sending of a document; sending should be apparent from the movement of the document. We should not use manual processes to file documents; show document going into files. Also, the open source and a code should be legal. Checking for vulnerabilities before sending any source will be the best way for securing the system.
