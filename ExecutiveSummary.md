The goal was to find out if the community for each open source software package was responsive to security questions or vulnerability findings; published security guidelines maintained a secure.

###Problems:
	The bigger problem of the open source code is the Data storage, in addition,  
Information process could be one of the open source problem, input or output also included. Vulnerabilities are one of the important issues to developers.


###Solutions:
	Manual process is not needed to show the sending of a document; sending should be apparent from the movement of the document.
	Do not use manual processes to file documents; show document going into files.
	the open source and a code should be legal.
